####### Needed matterial and Ideas ##########
# 1. will need to take photos with given interval 
# and save each 2nd to last as previous so when i first see a click i can use the both eye
# images for that click location
#
# 2. mouse needs to run in a loop
#   - need photo taker
#   - need eye state checker - will use math at first and possibly transition to ml
#   - if state has one closed then use ai model to determine location
#   -  need a function that clicks on a given location input
#   - if mouse clicks (we missed) then save that for next training cycle. retrain after every 100?
#
# 3. for training the AI model gather 1000 clicks and images then train before starting the loop 
#   - maybe still do straining screen for extremes (corners and halfway points)
